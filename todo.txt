1. Create a file for the openmp version of the algorithm in omp and a python script
   to compare the results with the groundtruth, model checker.
2. Write one or two versions of the algorithm in openmp. Check them and compute average time
   with several cores. 
3. Create a bash fiel to run the program with several cores and save times once the model is 
been evaluated
